# Phase 1 Complete: Foundation Setup ‚úÖ

## What We Accomplished Today

### üèóÔ∏è Infrastructure Deployed
- **Kubernetes Cluster**: 3-node cluster running locally with kind
- **Prometheus**: Metrics collection and storage
- **Grafana**: Dashboards and visualization
- **Jaeger**: Distributed tracing (partially running)

### üîß Access URLs
- **Grafana**: http://localhost:30000
  - Username: `admin`
  - Password: `admin123`
- **Prometheus**: http://localhost:30090
- **AlertManager**: http://localhost:30093
- **Jaeger**: http://localhost:30686 (when ready)

### üìö Key Concepts Learned
1. **Kubernetes Architecture**: Pods, Services, Namespaces, Deployments
2. **Helm Package Management**: Installing complex applications with charts
3. **Service Types**: NodePort vs ClusterIP for external access
4. **Observability Stack**: How Prometheus, Grafana, and Jaeger work together
5. **OpenTelemetry**: Data collection standard that feeds into monitoring tools

### üéØ Interview Talking Points You Can Use
- "I set up a local Kubernetes cluster with kind and deployed a full observability stack"
- "I configured Prometheus for metrics collection, Grafana for dashboards, and Jaeger for distributed tracing"
- "I understand the difference between NodePort and ClusterIP services for external access"
- "I can explain how OpenTelemetry collects data and sends it to different monitoring systems"

## What's Next (When You Return)

### Phase 2: Deploy Microservices
1. **Product Service**: Python/Flask API with OpenTelemetry
2. **Order Service**: Go service with distributed tracing
3. **Payment Service**: Python service with failure simulation

### Phase 3: Kubernetes Deployment
- Write Kubernetes manifests
- Deploy services with health checks
- Configure auto-scaling

### Phase 4: Observability & SLOs
- Create Grafana dashboards
- Set up Prometheus alerts
- Practice incident response

## Quick Commands to Remember

```bash
# Check what's running
kubectl get pods -n monitoring

# Access Grafana
open http://localhost:30000

# Check services
kubectl get services -n monitoring

# View logs
kubectl logs -f deployment/prometheus-grafana -n monitoring
```

## Files Created
- `kind-config.yaml` - Kubernetes cluster configuration
- `k8s/monitoring/` - Helm values for observability stack
- `services/` - Microservices code (ready to deploy)
- `setup.sh` - Automated setup script

You're ready to continue with microservices deployment when you return! üöÄ
