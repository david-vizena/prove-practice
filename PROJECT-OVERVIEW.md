# SRE Interview Prep: Production-Ready Microservices Platform

## Project Overview

A **production-ready e-commerce microservices system** with comprehensive observability, deployed on Kubernetes, demonstrating core SRE competencies including monitoring, incident response, and infrastructure automation.

## Architecture

**Three Microservices:**
1. **Product Service** (Python/Flask) - REST API for product catalog
2. **Order Service** (Go) - Handles order processing with distributed tracing
3. **Payment Service** (Python/FastAPI) - Payment processing with failure simulation

**Observability Stack:**
- OpenTelemetry instrumentation (traces, metrics, logs)
- Prometheus for metrics collection and alerting
- Grafana for visualization dashboards
- Jaeger for distributed tracing
- Structured logging with correlation IDs

**Infrastructure:**
- Kubernetes cluster (kind - local development)
- Terraform for Infrastructure as Code
- Auto-scaling configurations
- Health checks and monitoring

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Foundation
- Kubernetes cluster setup with kind
- Observability stack deployment (Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger)
- Service mesh configuration
- Network policies and security

### Phase 2: Microservices Development
- **Product Service:** Flask API with OpenTelemetry auto-instrumentation
  - REST endpoints with SQLite database
  - Custom metrics and structured logging
  - Health checks and graceful shutdown
- **Order Service:** Go service with manual OpenTelemetry instrumentation
  - HTTP client with distributed tracing
  - Error handling and retry logic
  - Business logic instrumentation
- **Payment Service:** FastAPI service with failure simulation
  - Async processing with deliberate failure scenarios
  - Configurable latency and error rates
  - Incident simulation endpoints

### Phase 3: Kubernetes Deployment
- Production-ready Kubernetes manifests
- Resource limits and requests
- HorizontalPodAutoscaler configuration
- Liveness and readiness probes
- Service discovery and load balancing

### Phase 4: Observability & SLOs
- Grafana dashboards for RED metrics (Rate, Errors, Duration)
- Resource utilization monitoring
- Business metrics tracking
- Prometheus alert rules based on SLOs:
  - 99% availability target
  - P95 latency < 500ms
  - Error rate < 1%
- AlertManager configuration

### Phase 5: Infrastructure as Code
- Terraform modules for:
  - Kubernetes cluster configuration
  - Namespace and RBAC setup
  - Monitoring stack deployment
- State management and module reusability
- Environment-specific configurations

### Phase 6: Incident Response & Testing
- Failure injection and chaos engineering
- Incident response procedures
- Root cause analysis using distributed traces
- Post-incident review documentation
- Performance testing and optimization

## Technical Stack

**Languages & Frameworks:**
- Python (Flask, FastAPI)
- Go (Gin framework)
- OpenTelemetry SDK

**Infrastructure:**
- Kubernetes (kind)
- Docker containerization
- Terraform
- Helm package management

**Observability:**
- Prometheus (metrics)
- Grafana (visualization)
- Jaeger (tracing)
- OpenTelemetry (instrumentation)

## Key Features

- **Distributed Tracing:** End-to-end request tracking across services
- **Metrics Collection:** Custom business and system metrics
- **Alerting:** SLO-based alerting with AlertManager
- **Auto-scaling:** CPU and memory-based scaling
- **Health Monitoring:** Comprehensive health checks
- **Incident Simulation:** Configurable failure scenarios for testing
- **Infrastructure as Code:** Fully automated deployment

## Interview Talking Points

This project demonstrates:

1. **Observability:** OpenTelemetry implementation across Python and Go services, distributed tracing with Jaeger, and comprehensive metrics collection with Prometheus

2. **Kubernetes:** Multi-service deployment with auto-scaling, resource management, and production-ready configurations

3. **Infrastructure as Code:** Terraform modules for infrastructure provisioning, following DRY principles with reusable components

4. **Incident Response:** Simulated production incidents, debugging with distributed traces, and systematic root cause analysis

5. **Performance Engineering:** Auto-scaling based on metrics, SLO-based alerting, and performance optimization

6. **Production Readiness:** Health checks, graceful shutdowns, error handling, and monitoring best practices

## Cost Optimization

- **Local Development:** kind cluster (free)
- **Open Source Tools:** Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger (free)
- **Cloud Resources:** Optional AWS deployment (~$5-10 for testing)
- **Terraform:** Free infrastructure automation tool
